# Extension Icons

This directory should contain the extension icons in the following sizes:

- `icon16.png` - 16x16 pixels (for extension bar)
- `icon32.png` - 32x32 pixels (for extension management)
- `icon48.png` - 48x48 pixels (for extension management)
- `icon128.png` - 128x128 pixels (for Chrome Web Store)

## For Development

For development purposes, you can use placeholder icons or create simple PNG files with the required dimensions.

## Design Guidelines

- Use a recognizable symbol related to time tracking or focus
- Keep the design simple and clear at small sizes
- Use consistent colors matching the extension theme
- Ensure good contrast for visibility

The extension will work without icons, but they improve the user experience and are required for Chrome Web Store submission.
